# Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch

## GradCAM:
~ GradCAM is the Gradient Class Activation Map. 
~ It helps us to indicate or show us the specific discriminative region of the image that influences the DL model to make the decision of classification.

## Image Segmentation:

🔍 Custom Datasets:

~ Mastered segmentation datasets.
~ Developed a custom dataset class for image-mask pairs.
~ Used Albumentations for advanced segmentation augmentations.
~ Ensured data quality through visualization of image-mask pairs.

🧠 Pretrained Models:

~ Loaded and understood state-of-the-art models like Unet using the Segmentation Models PyTorch library.

🔧 Model Training:

~ Built robust training and evaluation functions.
~ Effectively trained the segmentation model through a comprehensive training loop.
